## JSR #376 Public Review 

* JSR 376 (Project Jigsaw) did not pass public review
* JPMS public review ballot was not approved
* No votes from RedHat, IBM, Twitter, Eclipse, LJC, ...
* EG have 30 days to get consensus

Note:
30 days to get Final draft ratified - Final release scheduled for July

Lot of talking past each other.  RedHat's points shot down in the past.
Tooling support for Jigsaw is a real issue, probably a good thing for 
the EG to get a bit more time to get consensus and clarify the spec.
